    "## Prior results\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior work by Lloyd et al. (2006) shows the connection between network structure and the spread of infections using a Watts-Strogatz model. They note that the surprising result of the Watt-Strogatz model is that a relatively small number of rewired edges has a large (nonlinear) effect on the path lengths between nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lloyd et al. demonstrate that infected ratio is also nonlinearly increasing in the rewiring rate, with a steep inflection point between .001 and .01. They address precursors to this result in the use of percollation theory [cite] to explain epidemic sizes, though their discussion is largely about the difference between network epidemics and those in well-mixed populations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This work, as well as intuition, suggests that an individual edge is structurally significant to the spread of an infection in part due to how much it impacts the shortest path lengths between other nodes. This can be measured precisely by comparing the _average distance_ between nodes in the graph with the edge, and with the edge removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "As rewiring rate $p$ increases, the \"first\" rewired edge reduces the average distance significantly; the \"second\" edge less so, and so on. With a high rate of $p$, an individually rewired edge has only a small effect on average distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "One measure of the role of an edge in average distances is _edge betweenness centrality_: the number of shortest paths between nodes that run through an edge. A singular rewired edge will have a very high betweenness centrality. In a random graph (which is approximated if $p = 1$) the distribution of edge betweeness will be far more flat.\n",
    "\n",
    "We posit (and can test) that edges with higher betweeness centrality matter more for infectiousness. [We suspect based on preliminary work that these edges are _not_ as significant for contact tracing, which is significant because...]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Privacy as protection from information infection\n",
    "\n",
    "We have intuitively settled on the idea that a 'distant' edge is one that may be more sensitive than a 'close' edge. But why is that?\n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed above, 'distant' edges on a rewired lattice are those responsible for shortening average path distances between nodes. One thing that defines the local neighborhood of a lattice is that all the nodes in a neighborhood are a short distance from each other. Indeed, a neighborhood might be defined as a set of nodes such that each included node is at most a distance of $d$ from the others. When $d = 1$, a neighborhood is a clique. [Is there a more canonical term for this?]\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that each individual $u$ is aware of an edge, or lack of edge, between other individuals $v$ and $w$ with a decreasing probability based on their distance to $v$ and $w$. Then $u$ will be more aware of edges within their neighborhood than those outside of their neighborhood. If there is a \"distant\" edge between $w$ and non-neighborhood individual $x$, then that edge is less likely to be known to $u$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, we are considering the \"privacy\" of edges to be based on an implicit information diffusion of the graph's structure to the nodes within the structure itself. This information diffusion has some elements in common with a process of infection or percolation.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason [which we should spell out more], there is a sense in which the edges that are structurally _most private_ are also structurally _most important for infection_. This sets up a tension that we explore directly with out models."

    "### Our model\n",
    "\n",
    "We model a population with a graph $G$ in which nodes represent individuals and weight edges represent the chance of a contact occurring between those individuals. A disease spreads along this network according to a standard SEIR model, with some augmentations. Infected individuals may become _Symptomatic_, at which point they undergo testing and _Quarantine_, effectively removing themselves from the pandemic spread. The contact tracing system works by recording past contacts and spreading testing and quarantining along these traced paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "Individuals may or may not participate in the contact tracing system. An edge is only traced if both end nodes are _Adopters_ of the system. Also, there may be edges that are not traced because the individual chooses not to trace that specific edge. "
