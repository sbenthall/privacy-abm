# privacy-abm

This repository contains scripts and analysis for modeling privacy dynamics using ABMs.

Currently it contains code for two lines of inquiry:

- `contact-tracing` - explorations of the role of privacy in the efficacy of contact tracing.
- `norm-evolution` - explorations of how privacy norms form.
